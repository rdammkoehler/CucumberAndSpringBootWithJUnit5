# (Eventually A) Rest Assurred Example

This project started out as an example of using RESTAssurred. I got so engrossed in finding a way to have my CucumberJVM
tests coexist with the JUnit5 Tests that I forgot to use Rest Assurred. Maybe on another day.

## Configure for Run

It's Maven, do what seems right

## Configure for Dev/Contrib

Not accepting PRs just yet.

## How to Run

From the IDE works pretty well, haven't tried anything else

### What is interesting

Cucumber and JUnit5 don't get along; so I used the Cucumber Runner and I was still able to get things working.

# TODOs

* better readme
* actually use Rest Assured
* travis.yml
